##### https://github.com/jjzeroday/handyscripts/blob/main/ubuntu_update_maintenance_script.sh </link>
###### Nice beginner friendly to encourage maintenance of updating ubuntu. It is wise to read the comments to understand what is happening as will hopefully aid in why its important. I would run this weekly or on each fresh snapshot/iso

###### Errors that may be encountered.

<br>For this error I just made a typo as the proof-of-concept. It is important to read the errors carefully as they usually include the information needed to google or to ask ChatGPT.

<br><br>`E: Type 'deb[arch=amd64' is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list`
<br>`E: The list of sources could not be read.`

<br>We can see the second line mentions `The list of sources could not be read.`. I will ask a formatted question to ChatGPT to aid in teaching how to resolve similar issues.

<br>ChatGPT gave a perfect answer and noticed the typo I made, I forgot to include a space which can happen due to formatting from copy-paste.

<br>The issue is now resolved
